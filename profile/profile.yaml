    # Please read the project description guideline carefully. Make sure you follow the simplified SDLC pattern. (t.ly/NlXQ)
    # Please include the following keywords: CentOS, Bash/Shell, docker, RDBMS/SQL/Postgresql, crontab, data analytics
    description: Implemented Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent tool that manages a CentOS7 cluster comprising 10 nodes interconnected via a switch. The tool records hardware specifications and monitors real-time resource usage, like CPU and memory, across nodes for generating future resource planning reports. Utilizing Bash, it automates tasks using crontab scheduler which runs the scripts on node computers every minute and gets the usage data. PostgreSQL (psql) handles database management and querying, Git tracks source code changes for version control, and Docker ensures efficient containerization.
